### Requirements for running the MGen compiler

 * Java 1.7 or newer. (tested with OpenJRE 7 and Oracle's JRE7 & 8)


### Requirements for building MGen applications

Specific programming language compilers are only required if you are going to develop in that language. You don't need a C++ compiler if you're just going to build Java applications with MGen.

 * Java 1.7 or newer. Tested with OpenJDK 7 and Oracle's JDK7 & 8
 * C++98 or newer. Tested with GCC, VS and Clang
 * JavaScript: JavaScript 1.8.1 environment


### Requirements for building MGen from sratch

You normally don't need to build MGen to use it, as it is released in JAR form for java and as a header-only library for c++, but should you wish to build it from scratch and/or run its tests, you can check the instructions at <a href="https://github.com/culvertsoft/mgen">github repository</a>.
