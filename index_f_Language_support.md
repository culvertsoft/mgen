## Language support 

The currently supported languages are:

 * C++
 * Java
 * JavaScript

We plan to support further languages, and will prioritize by demand. The MGen toolkit is designed to be easily extendable to further languages by just adding custom code generator plug-ins to the MGen compiler.
