Contains all the java components of MGen - that is:

 * The MGen java library 
 * The MGen compiler components

You will probably depend on MGen through Maven/Ivy/Gradle, but if you want to include the jar files manually instead, you can use them directly from the 'jars' folder. The files you need in that case are:

 * mgen-api
 * mgen-javalib

Check the [dependencies section](index_e2_Dependencies.html) to see what external dependencies these have if adding jar files manually to your build.
