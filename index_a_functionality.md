## Summary of functionality

MGen lets you:

 * Define your applications' data model in one place
 * Generate representations/classes for multiple languages
 * Map binary data, string data (JSON, XML, tables..) directly to objects
 * Map config files directly to objects
 * Map command line arguments directly to objects
 * Map data between scripting languages and host languages
 * Share the state of your application over network
 * Model driven data generation (e.g. for testing)
 * Stay backwards compatible with old data and clients
 * Customize serialization through generated visitor methods
 * Combine data model definitions from multiple IDLs
 * Add your own IDL parsers through MGen's plug-in architecture
 * Add custom code generators through MGen's plug-in architecture
 * Edit generated code directly, and re-generate!

Bottom line, MGen let's you build:

 * Accessible, comprehensible, cross-language data models that you come back to later and understand and attach to new (external or your own) interfaces.
