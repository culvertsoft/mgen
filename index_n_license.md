## License alternatives

As we haven't yet decided exactly how to distribute or license MGen, we currently keeping it under a GPL v2 license. But we will also release MGen with a more commercially compatible license eventually (it will always stay available for open source GPL projects under GPL v2, should you prefer using that). 

This will probably result in one of two things:

 * Either we will add a commercial license alternative that you can purchase from us.
 * Or release MGen under a completely free license such as MIT. 

It depends on what interest we find for MGen as a product.
