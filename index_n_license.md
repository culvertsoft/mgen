## License alternatives

As we haven't yet decided exactly how to distribute or license MGen, we currently keeping it under GPL v2. We will release MGen with a more commercially compatible license eventually. 

 * Either we will add a commercial license alternative.
 * Or release MGen under a completely free license such as MIT.
