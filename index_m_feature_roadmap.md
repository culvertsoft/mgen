## Feature road map and future plans

There are several features we would like to have implemented at some point in the future. Below are some of these:

 * Add support for Python (generator + library)
 * Add support for C# (generator + library)
 * Build or integrate a gui application for data model design
 * Add support for custom allocators (c++)
 * Add support for std:: and boost:: smart pointers (c++)
 * Add generated operators "<<", "<" and ">" (c++)
 * Add support for C++11 features
 * Add support for mixins
 * Add support for ordered maps
 * Add support for sets
 * Add support for read-only fields (only setable in constructors)
 * Better naming of boolean getters (getSet() -> isSet())
 * Add support for IDL: Xml Schema
 * Add support for IDL: JSON Schema
 * Add support for further languages

We also have some sketches for something we call [MNet](https://github.com/culvertsoft/mnet/) (working name), which is intended to be a language agnostic software network infrastructure / service bus provider.
