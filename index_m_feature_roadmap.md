## Feature road map and future plans

We have several features that we want to implement for MGen in the future. 
Below is a list of the highest priority items on our wish list:

 * Add support for Python (generator + runtime library)
 * Add support for C# (generator + runtime library)
 * Finish building our visual gui application for data model design
 * Add support for custom allocators (c++)
 * Add support for std:: and boost:: smart pointers (c++)
 * Add generated operators "<<", "<" and ">" (c++)
 * Add support for mixins
 * Add support for ordered maps
 * Add support for sets
 * Add support for read-only fields (only setable in constructors)
 * Better naming of boolean getters (getSet() -> isSet())
 * Add support for IDL: Xml Schema
 * Add support for IDL: JSON Schema
 * Add support for further languages

We'd also like to start work on sister products to mgen. At this point our first follow-up product will be something we call MNet (working name), which is intended to be a language agnostic software network infrastructure / service bus provider.
