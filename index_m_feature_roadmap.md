## Feature road map / wish list

Below are features on our current wish list. This could be a good place to start if you're interested in making a contribution to MGen. Send us a message if you think we're missing something important.

 * Support for Python (generator + library)
 * Support for C# (generator + library)
 * A new dedicated non-XML IDL (plug-in).
 * Better naming of generated boolean getters (getSet() -> isSet())
 * A gui application for data model design
 * Support for custom allocators (c++)
 * Support for std:: and boost:: smart pointers (c++)
 * Generated operators "<<", "<" and ">" (c++)
 * Support for C++11 features
 * Support for mixins
 * Support for ordered maps
 * Support for sets
 * Support for read-only fields (only setable in constructors)
 * Support for Xml Schema
 * Support for JSON Schema

We also have some sketches for something we call [MNet](https://github.com/culvertsoft/mnet/) (working name), which is intended to be a language agnostic communication layer.
