## Feature road map and future plans

We have several features that we may implement for MGen in the future. 
Below are some of these:

 * Add support for Python (generator + runtime library)
 * Add support for C# (generator + runtime library)
 * Finish building our visual gui application for data model design
 * Add support for custom allocators (c++)
 * Add support for std:: and boost:: smart pointers (c++)
 * Add generated operators "<<", "<" and ">" (c++)
 * Add support for C++11 features
 * Add support for mixins
 * Add support for ordered maps
 * Add support for sets
 * Add support for read-only fields (only setable in constructors)
 * Better naming of boolean getters (getSet() -> isSet())
 * Add support for IDL: Xml Schema
 * Add support for IDL: JSON Schema
 * Add support for further languages

We also have some sketches for something we call [MNet](https://github.com/culvertsoft/mnet/) (working name), which is intended to be a language agnostic software network infrastructure / service bus provider.
