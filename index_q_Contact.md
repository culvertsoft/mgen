### Discussion forum <a name="c">&nbsp;</a>

We're planning to set up a discussion forum for support and questions. This is planned for the inital beta release.


### Bug reports <a name="c">&nbsp;</a>

Head over to our [github repository](https://github.com/culvertsoft/mgen) and click *issues* to report any bugs. The more reports we get - the more bugs we can fix!


### Support <a name="a">&nbsp;</a>

You can reach us at johan@culvertsoft.se or mikael@culvertsoft.se for support and questions about MGen and our plans. We'll try to answer as best as we can.


### Sales <a name="b">&nbsp;</a>

We haven't yet decided on a licensing or business model (if there will be any), but your always welcome to contact us with suggestions at johan@culvertsoft.se or mikael@culvertsoft.se.
