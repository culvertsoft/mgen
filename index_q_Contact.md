### Support

You can reach us at johan@culvertsoft.se or mikael@culvertsoft.se for support and questions about MGen and our plans. We'll try to answer as best as we can.


### Business?

We haven't yet decided on a licensing or business model (if there will be any), but your always welcome to contact us with suggestions at johan@culvertsoft.se or mikael@culvertsoft.se.

We're planning to host a website at [www.culvertsoft.se](http://www.culvertsoft.se). 


### Bug reports

Head over to our [github repository/issues](https://github.com/culvertsoft/mgen/issues) to report any bugs. The more reports we get - the more bugs we can fix! Please include the version you use (check your installation directory/BUILD.txt, where you can find the commit tag and date)
