### Business

We are not planning any immediate business for MGen, but you are always welcome to contact us with suggestions.
At some point we might host a website at [www.culvertsoft.se](http://www.culvertsoft.se). 


### Bug reports

Head over to our [github repository/issues](https://github.com/culvertsoft/mgen/issues) to report any bugs. The more reports we get - the more bugs we can fix! Please include the version you use (check your installation directory/BUILD.txt, where you can find the commit tag and date)
