## Download links

As soon as we release a tagged beta version of MGen it will be available on this page. In the meantime you can download our SNAPSHOT or Nightly's from:

 * [snapshot.culvertsoft.se](http://snapshot.culvertsoft.se)
 * [nightly.culvertsoft.se](http://nightly.culvertsoft.se)

For maven users wanting to build applications with MGen, the easiest way to depend on the MGen java libraries is to depend on mgen-javalib. Currently only our snapshot builds are available from maven, see:
