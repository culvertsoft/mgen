If you prefer to set up your project manually, add the following libraries to your build:

 * [mgen-api.jar](index_e1_Installation.html)
 * [mgen-javalib.jar](index_e1_Installation.html)
 * [MGen's external java dependencies](index_e2_Dependencies.html) 

The mgen jar files, sources and javadoc are available in the MGEN_INSTALL_PATH/jars, once you have installed MGen. See the [Installation section](index_e1_Installation.html) for more information.
