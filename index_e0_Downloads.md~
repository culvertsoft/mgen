## Download links

As soon as we release a tagged beta version of MGen it will be available on this page. In the meantime you can download our SNAPSHOT or Nightly's from:

 * [snapshot.culvertsoft.se](http://snapshot.culvertsoft.se)
 * [nightly.culvertsoft.se](http://nightly.culvertsoft.se)

For maven users wanting add the MGen runtime libraries to their java appliation build, the easiest way is to depend on mgen-javalib. Currently our snapshot builds are available from maven, see:

 * [oss.sonatype.org/#nexus-search;quick~mgen](https://oss.sonatype.org/#nexus-search;quick~mgen)

If using Maven, add the following repository urls:
 
 * https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/
 * https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/
