## Installing MGen

First, download the MGen version you prefer (see the [Downloads section](index_e0_Downloads.html)) and unzip it where you like to have it installed, and you should see a file structure as follows:

    ├── bin
    ├── include
    ├── jars
    ├── javascript
    ├── BUILD.TXT
    └── LICENSE.TXT


Then edit two environmental variables:

 * Set MGEN_INSTALL_PATH to your unzipped folder
 * Add MGEN_INSTALL_PATH/bin to your PATH

That's it. Now you have MGen installed and are ready to use it when building your applications.

For further explanations on what the different folders above contain, read on below.


### The 'bin' folder

Inside the bin folder are shell scripts and java .exe wrappers for executing the mgen compiler without explicitly calling java. If you followed the installation instruction above, you can simply type 'mgen' in your shell to run the MGen compiler.

If you instead want to call the mgen compiler directly with java, you can type 'java -jar mgen-compiler-[version]-assembly.jar' instead of 'mgen'.


### The 'include' folder

Contains the MGen c++ runtime libraries needed to build applications that use c++ code generated by the MGen compiler. Simply add this directory (preferrably with the environmental variable MGEN_INSTALL_PATH) to your c++ include paths.


### The 'jars' folder

Contains all the java components of MGen - that is:

 * The MGen java runtime libraries 
 * The MGen compiler components

You will probably depend on MGen through Maven/Ivy/Gradle, but if you want to include the jar files manually instead, you can use them directly from the 'jars' folder. The files you need in that case are:

 * mgen-api
 * mgen-javalib

Check the dependencies page to see what external dependencies these have if adding jar files manually to your build.


### The 'javascript' folder

Contains the MGen javascript runtime library. This is a single file called 'mgen-lib.js', which is the only file you need to use javascript code generated by the MGen compiler.
