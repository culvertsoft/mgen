## Installing MGen

First - Download the MGen version you prefer (see the [Downloads section](index_e0_Downloads.html)) and unzip it where you like to have it installed, and you should see a file structure as follows:

    ├── bin
    ├── include
    ├── jars
    ├── javascript
    ├── BUILD.TXT
    └── LICENSE.TXT


Then - Edit two environmental variables:

 * Set MGEN_INSTALL_PATH to your unzipped folder
 * Add MGEN_INSTALL_PATH/bin to your PATH

Lastly - Set the executable bit on the files inside the bin/ folder (not needed on Windows)

That's it. Now you have MGen installed and are ready to use it when building your applications. For further explanations on what the different folders above contain, read on below.


### Folder contents

Below follows a brief description of the contents of each folder in the install directory:

<div class="tabs"><a name="a">&nbsp;</a>
